              1st Round - Online test<br />
              -60 MCQs covering C/OOPS/Networks/OS<br />
              -2 coding questions in 1 hour (Choice of language: C, C++,
              Java)<br />
              (i) Finding number of primes between 2 numbers<br />
              (ii) Find the day for a given date<br />
              Around 28 people were shortlisted after this round.<br />
              There were 4 rounds of interviews. Questions were asked on basic
              data structures (trees, linked lists, arrays) along with the C
              code; Networks and OS fundamentals (Network and Transport layers,
              Paging, Threading, Virtual Memory, Thrashing, Process Management);
              Basics of Cloud Computing and Logic puzzles. Later rounds involve
              Resume discussions, role preferences, etc.

              (1) Elements of Programming Interviews (Aziz, Prakash, Lee)<br />
              (Note:- I found this to be the most useful book for preparation.
              Many companies ask questions that are slight modifications from
              the ones in the book. It contains some advanced level question
              which you can choose to skip, if you have less time)<br />
              (2) Cracking the coding interview by Laakmann<br /><br />
              C Apti:<br />
              (1) The C Programming Language (Kerringhan & Ritchie)<br />
              (2) The C++ Programming Language (Bjarne Stroustrup)<br />
              (Read the above 2 books to consolidate your fundamentals)<br />
              (3) Test your C Skills - Yashwant Kanetkar (For C Apti
              practice)<br /><br />
              OS<br />
              (1) Operating Systems Concepts (Gagne, Galvin, Silberschatz)

              (1) Computer Networks - Tanenbaum<br />
              (2) Data Communication & Networks - Forouzan<br />
              Also check out http://www.geeksforgeeks.com/ and
              http://www.careercup.com which have interview question sets for
              most Software companies.<br />
              (1) Don't just read or study algorithms from the books. Code them
              in C,C++ or Java so that you're well prepared for the coding
              round.<br />
              (2) Revise all the OS and Networks fundamentals properly before
              the placements begin.<br />
              (3) Since the first round eliminates bulk of the candidates, you
              might take a while to clear the first rounds of different
              companies. With each elimination, try to understand where you fell
              short and revise that before the next company.<br />
              (4) Ample companies come to campus, so don't get disheartened if
              you don't clear some round of a company.

              questions.<br />

              Overall it is quite an exhausting process. During the peak time of
              placements, you will probably write the first rounds for 4-5
              companies per day and could face multiple rejections at the
              preliminary or later stages. But over time you will get used to
              the process and will eventually get placed.
